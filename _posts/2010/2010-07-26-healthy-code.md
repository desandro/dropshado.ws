My mother's rule of thumb for determining a healthy meal was to judge a meal based on it's variety of color. A plate full of beige and brownish items translated into a unhealthy carb overload. You needed oranges, reds, greens.

I wonder if we can apply the same concept to code. Does a variety of syntax-highlighted colors relate to better code?
