> ALSO! bit.ly now uses custom shorteners when _anyone_ shrinks a url on a domain they manage. How cool is that??

[That's _pretty cool_](http://www.hulu.com/watch/194733/saturday-night-live-miley-cyrus-show).

Upon Dan's notice, I was jazzed to discover that bit.ly Pro service was open to the public, and free at that! I had been previously using [Yourls](http://yourls.org/) to serve up [d§.cc](http://d§.cc) URLs.

The free bit.ly Pro service does what you'd expect: generates shorten URLs for your own custom domain. But the killer feature Mr. Drinkard is talking about, [End-to-End (e2e) Domains](http://bit.ly/pro/help#e2edomain), isn't offered for Pro users.  

> End-to-End (e2e) Domain configuration is available to bit.ly Enterprise users only.
>
> e2e Domains enable complete end-to-end branding of your long URLs, no matter who shortens them.
>
> Here's an example: Let's say you configure "my-long-domain.com" as an e2e domain and your Custom Short Domain is "my-short.com". Any time **any** bit.ly user shortens a URL starting with "http://my-long-domain.com/", the resulting short link will start with "http://my-short.com/".

$1000 a year for an Enterprise account is not quite in my budget, but seems reasonable for the big players out there. Also a terrific selling point for the bit.ly Enterprise service, ensuring brand continuity for their clients.
