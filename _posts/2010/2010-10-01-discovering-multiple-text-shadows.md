Today, Paul Irish released [mothereffingtextshadow.com](http://mothereffingtextshadow.com/). In typical Paul Irish fashion, it is a remarkable delight. Mr. Irish was kind enough to leave a comment in the markup:

    all <3 goes to david desandro, who popularized this and many other amazing things.

The `<3` is felt, bro. 

But if anyone deserves `<3`, it would be [David Cole](http://www.davidcole.me/). I first found the technique employed in his work for Sleepover's [Chunky Tumblr theme](http://chunkytheme.tumblr.com/).  Mr. Cole's original implementation generated a triple offset border, an incredible innovation. While numerous others have picked up on my derivatives, I rarely see anyone use text-shadow the way he first did.
