re: [putImageData is a complete jerk](http://dropshado.ws/post/1244700472/putimagedata-is-a-complete-jerk) I don't know if this has been suggested already, but use drawImage instead [http://jsfiddle.net/JFSIII/Ga5jf/](http://jsfiddle.net/JFSIII/Ga5jf/)

The thing pulling it all together is converting the canvas into a data URL and using that as an image:

    var img = new Image();
    img.src = canvas2.toDataURL('image/png');
    ctx2.drawImage(img, 30, 10);

Gonna have to give him a back rub one of these days.
