Quickly link to a commit in a GitHub message. `SHA: ` followed by the first 7 or so of the commit SHA for that project will be converted into a link. For example, [I just dropped](https://github.com/desandro/isotope/issues/76#issuecomment-1904338):

    SHA: 49b5c3a6eb509
    
which became - SHA: [49b5c3a](https://github.com/desandro/isotope/commit/49b5c3a6eb509)

More goodies in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/). You can also quickly reference other projects and branches.
