After triggering screen capture with &#x2318;&#x21E7;4 (Cmd+Shift+4), you can use additional keys like in Photoshop. Holding down Shift (&#x21E7;) will keep lock one dimension, for changes to only the vertical or horizontal dimension. Holding down Option (&#x2325;) will cause the overlay to be sized symmetrically.

Tested only OS X Snow Leopard.  Not sure about earlier versions.
