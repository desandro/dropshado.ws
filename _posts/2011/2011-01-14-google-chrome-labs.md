> If you're running the dev build but still itching to try even more experimental (and possibly buggier) features, just type in `about:flags` in Chrome's address bar to see a list of experimental features available in the build.

You know it's awesome because there's a big warning sign.

I run the dev branch of Chrome, so it's nice to have an easy peak at what's coming down the road.

It's got an option for _GPU Accelerated Compositing_, which is encouraging as Chrome's transition and animation engine seriously lacks compared to Safari's or Firefox 4's.  So far, I haven't noticed any changes enabling it.

I do like the _Tab Overview_.
