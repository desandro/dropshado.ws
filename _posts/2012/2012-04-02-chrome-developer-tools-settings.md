Via [JFSIII](http://twitter.com/jfsiii), Chrome's Developer Tools has some useful options hidden in its settings panel. All this time, it has been hiding as that little cog icon in the bottom right.

Personal favorites include **Disable cache**, **Text Editor indent**, **Dock to right** which is ideal for mobile-sized media-query development.
